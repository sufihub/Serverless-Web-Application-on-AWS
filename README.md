# Serverless-Web-Application-on-AWS
# Project Name: Serverless Web Application on AWS:
# Project Description:
In this project, you will build a serverless web application using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3. The application will allow users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) items from a DynamoDB table.
# Project Architecture:
![228492073-5cd3d975-3439-4ce4-b109-fb33997df3c3](https://github.com/sufihub/Serverless-Web-Application-on-AWS/assets/124899223/be91baa7-82b8-42f2-8442-33c284121600)
# Steps to Build the Project:
. Create a DynamoDB table to store the items. \
. Build a Lambda function to handle the CRUD operations on the DynamoDB table. \
. Use S3 to store and host the web application's static files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). \
. Create a CloudFront distribution to serve the S3-hosted static files with low latency. \
# Expected Outcome:
Upon completing the project, you will have a working serverless web application hosted on AWS.
You will have hands-on experience building a serverless application using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, and CloudFront.
Additionally, you will have experience working with AWS services and integrating them to build a complete solution.

This project will help you improve your skills in cloud computing, serverless architecture, and AWS services.
